## Issue: Sensor Disconnects After Prolonged Operation

**Description:**  
After several hours of continuous operation, the sensor may lose connection and stop transmitting data.

**Cause:**  
This issue often arises from an unstable I2C connection or memory overload.

**Solution:**  
- Verify that the I2C connections are secure and that the pull-up resistors are properly sized.
- Consider implementing a microcontroller reset routine if the sensor disconnects.

**Example Script:**  
See `fix_sensor_disconnect.ino` in this directory for a sample script that attempts to automatically reconnect the sensor when a disconnect is detected.

## Issue: Inconsistent Data Readings

**Description:**  
The sensor outputs data that fluctuates or shows significant errors.

**Cause:**  
This can occur due to noise in the sensor environment, power supply instability, or incorrect sensor calibration.

**Solution:**  
- Ensure that the sensor is properly calibrated according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
- Add capacitors to the power supply lines to stabilize the voltage.
- Check for any sources of electromagnetic interference near the sensor.

**Example Script:**  
See `fix_inconsistent_readings.ino` in this directory for a sample script that applies a filter to smooth out erratic data.

## Issue: Compilation Errors

**Description:**  
Errors occur during the compilation of the .ino files.

**Cause:**  
Possible causes include missing libraries, outdated Arduino IDE versions, or incompatible code.

**Solution:**  
- Ensure all required libraries are installed and up to date.
- Update the Arduino IDE to the latest version.
- Check the Arduino forum or documentation for any specific errors you encounter.

**Example Script:**  
Not applicable. Refer to the specific error message for guidance.
