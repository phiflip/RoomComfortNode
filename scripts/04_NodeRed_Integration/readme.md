# Node-Red Integration

## Overview

In this week, we will explore how to integrate The Things Network (TTN) with Node-Red to visualize and manage the data from our IoT devices. Node-Red is a powerful flow-based development tool for visual programming, particularly suited for IoT applications.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Required for running Node-Red.
- **Node-Red**: Install via npm.
- **Additional Node-Red packages**: 
  - `node-red-dashboard`
  - `node-red-contrib-moment`
  - `node-red-contrib-ttn`
